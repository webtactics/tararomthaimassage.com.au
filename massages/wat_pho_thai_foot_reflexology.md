A centuries-old healing therapy combining Thai massage techniques with traditional reflexology. Let go of tensions as your therapist works on acupressure points from the knees down along with a traditional Thai foot massage stick to stimulate organ reflex points, activating healing and balancing throughout the body. Improves blood and lymphatic circulation, natural detoxification and promotes deep relaxation.
